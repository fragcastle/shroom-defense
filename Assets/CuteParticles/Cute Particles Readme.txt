Cute Particles v1.1

by Kenneth Foldal Moe
------------------------

Hello, and thank you for purchasing Cute Particles!

To add a particle effect to your scene, simply drag one of the Particle Systems to your scene and start your scene to preview it.
At default, the particles are all looping for demonstrative purposes for the demo.

Remember to turn off Loop for when instantiating explosions and similar "one-shot" particle effects!
Most of the particles in this pack are very easy to recolor, so you can easily customize them to fit into your environment.

If you intend to use these effects for a mobile game, make sure to reduce the texture size and amount of particles emitted to avoid performance issues.
The material type's shader can also be changed to "Mobile" for further optimisation.
